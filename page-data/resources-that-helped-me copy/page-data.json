By a lot, I mean clicking on almost every link that appears on the first 2 pages of Google, or even googling in another language. As I’m based in Japan, my google searches appear in Japanese and I do read the Japanese version of StackOverflow.</p>\n<p>Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg\">salted duck eggs</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck\neggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Resources that helped me","date":"March 29, 2020","description":"Resources that I've used when I started to learn to code"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/resources-that-helped-me copy/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/resources-that-helped-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Resources that helped me"}},"next":null}}}
