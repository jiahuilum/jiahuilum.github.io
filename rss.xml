&lt;p&gt;When I first started to learn to code, I did not want to spend any money (i.e., no online courses or real-life courses) as I thought it would be 1) more fulfilling to learn by myself 2) have higher monetary returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that a main bulk or debugging, or learning how to code, requires you to google A LOT. By a lot, I mean clicking on almost every link that appears on the first 2 pages of Google, or even googling in another language. As I’m based in Japan, my google searches appear in Japanese and I do read the Japanese version of StackOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
